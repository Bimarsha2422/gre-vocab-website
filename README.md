# GRE Vocabulary Companion

I created this project because I was having difficulty learning GRE vocabulary. The GRE Vocabulary Companion is designed to help you learn new words more effectively. You can access the website hosted on Github Pages at https://bimarsha2422.github.io/gre-vocab-website/. 

## Key Features

- **Context-based learning**: The vocabulary words are presented in the context of engaging texts, allowing you to understand how the words are used in real-world situations.
- **Guessing and confirmation**: The process of guessing the meaning of a word and then confirming it helps to solidify the word's understanding in your memory.
- **Customizable content**: You can easily clone the repository and add your own text by modifying the wordDictionary.js file. The site will automatically integrate them with the vocabulary learning features.
